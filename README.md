# covid_monthly_report
An R Markdown monthly report to analyse COVID-19 trends across a customisable selection of countries.

The code can be viewed in this .rmd markdown file [here](https://github.com/ctedja/covid_monthly_report/blob/main/COVID-19%20Regional%20Monthly%20Report.Rmd).

The potential end product can be viewed [here](https://ctedja.github.io/covid_monthly_report/). 

*Open to collaboration. (One potential next step could be to change the line chart into a 7-day rolling average).*
